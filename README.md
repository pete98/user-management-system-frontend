# User Management System Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the **User Management System** application. The frontend is built using **React** and provides an intuitive user interface for managing users, roles, and related features. It connects to the backend API to handle data and operations seamlessly.

## Features

- User authentication and session management.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- CRUD operations for users and roles.
- Responsive design for better usability on different devices.
- Integration with RESTful APIs for backend communication.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.

### Backend:
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building REST APIs efficiently.
- **Spring Security**: For implementing authentication and authorization (including JWT-based token management).
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **AWS RDS MySQL**: Relational database for storing user and role data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure communication between frontend and backend.
-  **AWS EC2**: Used for deploying the backend server

## How It Works

The frontend application allows administrators to manage the user base of the system. Key operations include:

1. **User Management**: Adding, editing, deleting, and viewing users.
2. **Role Management**: Assigning and updating roles for users.
3. **Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality.
4. **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of user-related statistics and actions.

The backend, built with **Spring Boot**, handles the business logic, data storage, and secure API communication. The system follows a layered architecture, ensuring modularity and scalability.
